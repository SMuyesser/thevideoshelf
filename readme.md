## The Video Shelf vimeo video manager

The Video Shelf web app was built for a friend's videography company.  His videos are all on vimeo, 
but he needed a way to organize them on his own website.  The Video Shelf allows the user to login,
and then register clients with their name, logo, and vimeo videos.  A client's page can then be viewed 
to see their videos and request more filming work.  This app allows client information to be updated 
easily and increase productivity for the business.  
To test it out, login with the following credentials.
username: twhalen
password: 1234

Or feel free to create your own login and add your own vimeo videos.
